description: "Riders of the Purple Sage is a Western novel by Zane Grey, first published\
  \ by Harper & Brothers in 1912. Considered by many critics to have played a significant\
  \ role in shaping the formula of the popular Western genre, the novel has been called\
  \ \"the most popular western novel of all time.\"\nRiders of the Purple Sage tells\
  \ the story of Jane Withersteen and her battle to overcome persecution by members\
  \ of her polygamous Mormon fundamentalist church. A leader of the church, Elder\
  \ Tull, wants to marry her. Withersteen gets help from a number of friends, including\
  \ Bern Venters and Lassiter, a famous gunman and killer of Mormons. Throughout most\
  \ of the novel she struggles with her \"blindness\" to the evil nature of her church\
  \ and its leaders, and tries to keep Venters and Lassiter from killing the adversaries\
  \ who are slowly ruining her. When she adopts a child, Fay, she abandons her beliefs\
  \ and discovers her true love. A second plot strand tells of Venters and his escape\
  \ to the wilderness with a girl named Bess, \"the rustler's girl,\" whom he has\
  \ accidentally shot. Venters falls in love with the girl while caring for her. Together\
  \ they escape to the East, while Lassiter, Fay, and Jane, pursued by both Mormons\
  \ and rustlers, escape into a paradise-like valley and topple a giant rock to forever\
  \ close off the only way in or out.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
